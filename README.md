## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build Tool:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing (no React Router)

**UI Component Library:**
- Shadcn UI (New York variant) with Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design tokens
- Dark mode as the default theme

**State Management:**
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- React Context API for authentication state
- No global state management library (Redux/Zustand)

**Design System:**
- Typography: Source Code Pro (body), Poppins (headings), Inter (code)
- Color Palette: Rich dark grays (#0a0a0a background), white primary accent, orange gaming accent (#ff6b35)
- Custom CSS variables defined in index.css for theming
- Tailwind config extended with custom border radius and color tokens

**Key Libraries:**
- Framer Motion for animations and scroll effects
- React Typed for typing animations
- TSParticles for particle background effects
- React Hook Form + Zod for form validation
- React Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Express.js with TypeScript
- ESM module system (type: "module")
- Session-based authentication using express-session with MemoryStore

**API Structure:**
- RESTful API design
- Routes organized in `/api` namespace:
  - `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints (register, login, logout)
  - `/api/projects/*` - Project CRUD operations
  - `/api/skills/*` - Skills CRUD operations
  - `/api/blog/posts/*` - Blog post management
  - `/api/blog/posts/:id/comments` - Comment system
  - `/api/blog/posts/:id/star` - Post starring feature

**Development Setup:**
- Vite middleware mode for HMR in development
- Production builds serve static files from dist/public
- Replit-specific plugins for error overlay and dev tools

### Data Storage

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL via Neon serverless driver (@neondatabase/serverless)
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Schema-first approach with migrations in `/migrations` directory

**Schema Design:**
- `users` table: Authentication and user profiles (username, email, hashed passwords with bcrypt)
- `projects` table: Portfolio projects with tech stack, features, URLs, images
- `skills` table: Technical skills categorized by type with proficiency levels
- `blog_posts` table: Blog content with slug (SEO-friendly URLs), tags, publish status, star count, views
- `blog_comments` table: Comment system linked to posts
- `post_stars` table: Track user stars on blog posts (many-to-many relationship)

**Storage Implementation:**
- IStorage interface defines data access contract
- MemStorage class provides in-memory implementation for development
- All operations return Promises for async compatibility
- Separate types for insert operations vs. full entities

### Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Strategy:**
- Session-based authentication (not JWT)
- Bcrypt for password hashing (10 salt rounds)
- HTTP-only cookies for session management
- Session secret configurable via environment variable

**User Flow:**
- Registration creates user with hashed password
- Login validates credentials and creates session
- Logout destroys session
- `/api/auth/me` endpoint returns current user or null
- Frontend AuthContext wraps authentication state

**Authorization:**
- User ID stored in session for authenticated requests
- Blog post authorship verified by authorId field
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with 4 roles: admin, editor, author, reader
- Middleware for role-specific route protection (requireAdmin, requireEditor, requireAuthor)
- User status checks (banned, muted, can post)
- Dynamic permission system based on user role and status

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services

**Database:**
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL (requires DATABASE_URL environment variable)

**Development Tools:**

- These plugins only load in Replit environment (REPL_ID check)

## Recent Changes (October 2025)

### Blog System Enhancements

**SEO-Friendly URLs (Slug Feature):**
- Added `slug` field to `blog_posts` table (unique, auto-generated from titles)
- Slug generation: converts title to lowercase, replaces non-alphanumeric chars with hyphens
- Automatic uniqueness check with counter suffix if needed (e.g., "my-post", "my-post-1")
- Updated all blog URLs to use slugs instead of IDs (`/blog/{slug}` instead of `/blog/{id}`)
- Backend routes support both ID and slug lookups for backward compatibility
- Create/edit mutations properly handle slug in redirect URLs

**Mobile Responsiveness Improvements:**
- Blog list page: Reduced padding on mobile (`px-4 md:px-6`), adjusted heading sizes (`text-xl md:text-2xl`)
- Blog post page: Converted two-column layout to single column on mobile (`flex-col lg:flex-row`)
- Table of Contents: Hidden on mobile/tablet, visible on desktop only (`hidden lg:block`)
- Blog create/edit pages: Mobile-friendly padding and form layouts
- Card padding: Responsive padding (`p-4 md:p-6`, `p-4 md:p-8`)
- Cover images: Responsive height (`h-48 md:h-64`)

**Technical Updates:**
- Fixed TypeScript errors in blog create/edit mutation handlers
- Updated storage layer to generate and handle slugs
- Maintained backward compatibility for ID-based lookups
- All blog-related components now mobile-first responsive
